## Configuration  
To use AeroPredict with the OpenWeatherMap API, you need to obtain an API key. Follow these steps to set up your API key:  

* Go to the OpenWeatherMap website: https://openweathermap.org/  
* Sign up for a free account or log in if you already have an account.  
* Once logged in, go to your profile and navigate to the **API Keys** section.  
* Generate a new API key and copy it.  
* In the project directory, locate the `script.js` file. Inside this file, you will find a constant called `API_KEY`. Replace the placeholder value `'YOUR_API_KEY'` with your actual API key obtained from OpenWeatherMap.
